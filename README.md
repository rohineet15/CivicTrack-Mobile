# CivicTrack-Mobile
**Empowering Citizens to Report Civic Issues**  
CivicTrack-Mobile is a mobile-first civic engagement platform that allows citizens to report and track local issues within a 3–5 km radius — such as:
- 🕳️ Potholes
- 🚮 Garbage overflow
- 💡 Broken streetlights
- 💧 Water leaks
- 🌳 Damaged public property

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Civic issues often go unnoticed or unreported due to lack of accessible reporting channels. This results in delayed resolutions and decreased quality of life. **CivicTrack bridges this gap** by empowering citizens to report problems directly from their smartphones and track issue status in real-time.

## 📱 Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple UI for quick reporting  
- **Geo-Tagging:** Auto-captures user location  
- **Issue Categories:** Predefined civic issue types  
- **Track Status:** Monitor the progress of your reports  
- **Real-Time Data:** Helps authorities identify problem zones

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Open the app  
2. Select issue type  
3. (Optional) Upload a photo  
4. Auto-detect or enter location  
5. Submit your report
